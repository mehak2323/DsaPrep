Given an array arr[] of positive numbers, The task is to find the maximum sum of a subsequence such that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array.

Examples: 

```
Input: arr[] = {5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5}
Output: 110
Explanation: Pick the subsequence {5, 100, 5}.
The sum is 110 and no two elements are adjacent. This is the highest possible sum.
```

```
Input: arr[] = {3, 2, 7, 10}
Output: 13
Explanation: The subsequence is {3, 10}. This gives sum = 13.
This is the highest possible sum of a subsequence following the given criteria
```

```
Input: arr[] = {3, 2, 5, 10, 7}
Output: 15
Explanation: Pick the subsequence {3, 5, 7}. The sum is 15.
```

### Solution 

```
int recurFun(){
    if(i==n) return;
}

int maximumNonAdjacentSum(vector<int> &nums){
    
}
```
Not completing for now, same question as House Robber, doing it instead :)))
